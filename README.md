# My Own Profile Website
- Space theme
    - with particles colliding with each other
- Tech Stack
    - ReactJS
        - SPA design
        - using Vanilla Javascript to write reuseable components.
        - using React context hooks for simpler state managements.
    - TailwindCSS
        - easy integration and implementation on chic styling with TailwindCSS
    - Firebase Database
        - using Firebase Database for storing data and being called at run time.
        - the comment section also connects to the Firebase Database for storage.
- Trial features
    - there is an audio player built and available, but the nature does not fit with the profiling website and is not applied to production.
